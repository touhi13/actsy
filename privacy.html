                  To manage any information we receive about you from a social networking site or other third parties (if applicable), you will need to follow the instructions from that party for updating your information and changing your privacy settings, where available.

                <h4 class="small-title">Your Rights</h4>
                <p>You have a number of rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. An outline of those
                   rights and how to exercise them is set out below. Please note that (a) for your protection, (i) we may require 
                   that a request to exercise your rights be sent through the email address associated with your account, and (ii) 
                   we may ask to verify your identity before responding to any such request by asking that you provide details only
                    known to the account holder; and (b) for each of 
                  the rights below we may have valid legal reasons to refuse your request. We will let you know if that is the case.</p>
                  <p> <span class="email">Access:</span>   You have the right to know whether we process personal information about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with. We will generally provide you with access to your personal information within 30 days, subject to some exceptions permitted by law. We will also generally provide access in the manner 
                    you have requested (e.g., by providing photocopies), provided it is reasonable and practical for us to do so.</p>
                  <p><span class="email">Correction:</span>You have the right to require us to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate, and have incomplete data completed. Where you request correction, please explain in detail why you believe the personal information we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required. Please note that while we assess whether the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete,
                     you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below.</p>
                     <p><span class="email">Erasure:</span>You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:</p>
                 <ul class="privacy" type="disc">
                   <li> where you believe it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal information;</li>
                   <li>where we are processing it on the basis of your consent and you wish to withdraw your consent;</li>
                   <li>where we are processing your data on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing;</li>
                   <li> where you no longer wish us to use your data to send you marketing;</li>
                   <li>where you believe we are unlawfully processing your data; or</li>
                   <li> where you have to do it to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                 </ul> <br> 
                 <p>Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in 
                  determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Restriction of processing to storage only:
                   You have a right to request that we limit the processing of
                   the personal information we hold about you (except to store it) in the following circumstances:</p>

                   <ul class="privacy">
                    <li>you believe the personal information is not accurate, 
                      for the period it takes for us to verify whether the data is accurate;</li>
                      <li>we wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing 
                        is unlawful, but you want us to simply restrict the use of that data;</li>
                      <li> we no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing but you require us to
                           retain the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>
                      <li>you have objected to us processing personal information we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal information, while we determine
                            whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal information.</li>
                   </ul><br>
                   <p> <span class="email">Portability:</span> You have the right to receive a copy of the personal 
                    information you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. 
                    You also have the right to request that we transfer such personal information to another party. 
                    If you wish for us to transfer the personal information to another party, please ensure you detail 
                    that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible (for example, we cannot
                     put your information into formats used by different information systems). We are not responsible 
                     for the security of the personal information, or its processing once received by the third party.</p>

                     <p> <span class="email">Objection:</span>  You have the right to object to our processing of data about you and we will consider your request. Please provide us with the specific reasons for your objection so that we can assess whether there are legitimate grounds for us to continue to process such data, including in relation to a legal claim. You also have the right,
                       at any time, to object to our processing of data about you in order to send you marketing.</p>
                     <p><span class="email">Withdrawal of Consent:</span> Where you have provided your consent to us
                       processing your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us in any of
                        the ways described in Section 10 below.</p>

                    <p>The Site is operated in the United States. If you are located outside the United States, please be aware that any information will be transferred to the United States. <br><br>
                      Some of the service providers we use to provide the Site and its functionality, or our products and services, may be located outside the country where you live (for example, servers storing data via a cloud service). Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is stored or processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. <br><br>
                      By providing us with your personal information, you consent to our use of it in accordance with this policy, including the transfer of your information across international boundaries. <br><br>
                      California Do Not Track Disclosures: <br><br>
                      California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Some browsers have “do not track” features that let you tell websites that you do not want to have your activities tracked. <br><br>
                      We do not track you over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and the Site does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your computer operating system (e.g. Safari) allows you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked. Third parties that have content embedded on our website, such as a social media link, may set cookies on a user’s browser and/or obtain information about the fact that the web browser visited this website from a certain IP address. 
                      Third parties cannot collect any other personal information from our website unless you provide it to them directly.</p>

                      <p>We generally retain personally identifiable information only for as long as necessary to provide you with access to the Site and, if applicable, our products and services. Some data you can delete whenever you like. In some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time. This is because business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, 
                        for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:</p>
